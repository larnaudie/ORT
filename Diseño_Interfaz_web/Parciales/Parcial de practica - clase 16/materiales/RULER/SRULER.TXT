  Screen Ruler is a great virtual ruler ready to be dragged 
  around on your computer screen. This Windows 95/NT 32bit 
  application is very useful to measure objects in Pixels. 
  It features a vertical or horizontal orientation, a dynamic 
  mouse measurement tracking, custom length, plus it can also 
  remain on top, above all windows. Try it! Named "Cool Tool" 
  by Internet World magazine. Very handy when designing Web 
  Pages and other screen layouts. The registered version is 
  even better.

Features
---------------------------------------------------------------

  * Double-click on the ruler itself to make it flip from
    horizontal to vertical orientation and vice-versa.

  * Left-click on the ruler to drag it to a new position.

  * Right-click on the ruler to bring up its menu.

  * Use the arrow keys to move the ruler 1 pixel at a time.
    The CTRL-Arrow Key combination allows you to move it by
    10 pixels at a time.

  * Clicking on the leftmost square icon will exit the program.

  * Clicking on the second square icon (with hatch marks) will
    flip the ruler. Equivalent to double-clicking on the ruler
    itself to change its orientation.

  * Clicking on the double-arrow icon allows you to drag the 
    right (or bottom) side of the ruler giving it a new custom 
    length. The minimum length on the unregistered version is 
    400 pixels (registered version is 300). The maximum length 
    is 1200 pixels. While you drag the grow icon, the ruler 
    tracks the new length in the measurement display.

  * The ruler dims its title "Screen Ruler" to gray when it's 
    NOT the currently active application (the one on the front) 
    even if it is marked to always be on top of all windows. 
    Click on the ruler or use ALT-Tab to make it active.

  * Screen Ruler uses a specially designed cursor. Its 1 pixel 
    tail-like line protrudes beyond the ruler itself as an aid 
    in precisely measuring objects down to the pixel. The cursor
    must be over the active or inactive ruler for it to change
    to its unique shape.

  * The mouse tracking mechanism constantly watches the cursor
    position and informs you of its location relative to the
    bottom left corner of the ruler (the zero point). Even when
    the ruler is NOT the currently active window.

  * Releasing the ALT key (or F10) pops up the menu. You can 
    then use the mouse or the arrow keys to make your selection. 
    Use the ESC key to send the menu away.

  * If your computer is equipped with a sound card capable of 
    playing wave files, one of the menu items will say "Make 
    Click Sound", otherwise it will just say "Make Beep Sound."
    When this menu item is checked, it allows a "click" sound
    to be heard when you move the ruler with the arrow keys.

  * If you need two or more rulers on the screen at the same 
    time, just double-click the Screen Ruler icon again, another
    copy of it will run.

  * The "About Screen Ruler" menu item has our address, e-mail, 
    home page, etc. It also contains notice of the fact that
    Screen Ruler is NOT free. It is being distributed on the 
    shareware honor system. That is, to continue its development
    we depend on continued user support in the form of payment of
    the shareware registration fee of only US$15. It's really
    up to you!

  * The "Register" menu item enables you to conveniently register
    Screen Ruler's shareware fee. If you have a web browser
    application such as Netscape or Internet Explorer installed
    in your computer, this menu runs it and automatically points 
    the browser to our web home page. Follow the links there to
    register online. If there's no browser installed, this menu
    opens a form file ready for you to fill it and mail it. This
    feature is also triggered from the "link" found in the "About
    Screen Ruler" dialog box.

  * When you send your US$15 registration fee, we will send you 
    via e-mail a copy with your name prominently displayed in 
    the About Box. To send via regular mail requires an extra 
    US$5. Please send your name, postal address, e-mail, phone 
    and also the version number you are registering. Please
    indicate that you are registering the Windows version, 
    because we also have a Macintosh version.

  * The "Help" menu brings up the document you are now reading.

  * Unregistered copies of Screen Ruler will randomly display at 
    startup, the message "Please Register Screen Ruler." After 
    some usage, it appends "Used x times." to the above message. 
    If that number gets too high, you might consider getting a 
    copy with your name in it.

  * The "Always on Top" menu item essentially makes the ruler
    always float above all windows. Technically speaking, it can
    go under other windows who share the same TOPMOST status.
  
  * The "Slide to Zero" menu item will shift the ruler 
    horizontally or vertically to the edge of the screen.

  * You may also use accelerator key combinations (such as
    CTRL-F, CTRL-S, CTRL-A and CTRL-M) for its features.

  * The "Minimize" menu item will shrink the ruler to an icon
    on the Windows taskbar.

  * When you exit Screen Ruler, it automatically saves its 
    settings in the Windows Registry.

  * Currently this version (1.0) of the ruler only measure in 
    Pixels. The remaining dimmed items in the menu reflect other 
    types of measurements implemented in the registered version.

Note
---------------------------------------------------------------

  The version you get when you register has more measurements
  and other cool enhancements. Well worth the small investment.

  We suggest you keep the Screen Ruler handy by dragging its 
  icon over the Widows 95 Start Button on the Taskbar.

  In all likelihood, this version has already been updated.
  Get the latest version. If you haven't registered yet, please 
  do. You will receive early notification of new releases
  plus a special version directly from us (via e-mail) with 
  your name prominently displayed in the About Box.

  If you get the message "This is an old version of Screen
  Ruler," is because it has been over a year since it was 
  released (time to get an updated version), or your computer
  clock is not set to the current date.
